Coming up with ideas

Some people come up with new ideas very easily. Other tries hard and can't come up with any ideas at all. Is creativity something we're born with? Or is it something that we can all develop? Personality can make a difference. A person who is open to new experiences may have advantage. He or she may be more curious and more interested in new ways of doing thing. But personality is the only key to creativity.

Many people think that the best way to solve a problem is to focus on it. However sometimes the best way to be creative is to walk away from a problem. Just like your mind wonder what you do something else. In fact, a lot of great ideas come in types of transitions. These inlude when you are waking up in the morning, falling asleep at night or taking a shower. By not focusing attention on a problem you may open your mind to new ways of solving it.

Psychologist studying creativity have also found that the color green may help people come up with creative ideas. One group of psychologist gave students a creativity test. The only difference was that there were different colors on the test cover page. The test cover pages for black, white, red, gray and green. Students with green test cover pages and more creative ideas than those with other colors. Another way to improve creativity is to regularly make time for letting your mind wonder. Go for a walk, look out the window or do something completely physical.

In other words, let your brain have a rest. This allows your brain to make connections that didn't occur you when you are focusing. If you don't take a break then your brain will not be creative. So don't be afraid to put a problem to one side for few minutes. It may be the best way to find a good solution to the problem.
