Learning from their's

French workers enjoy a standard 35 hour week. They like having more time to spend with their families. But is a short work week good for the country? Does it result in more job for the nation's workers? After the French revolution, local leaders went out into the country. And saw how people lived.

They were surprised that most farmers did not work in the field between Autumn and Spring. The farmers stayed in their homes. And spend the cold months doing almost nothing. After working hard during the 5 months of warm weather, they were resting. By resting they were preventing hunger. The whole family gathered around warm stove lay down and went to sleep. Once a day everyone got up to eat a piece of hard bread.

Then they went back to sleep. The member of the family took turns keeping the fire burning. This was not hibernating like what bears do in the winter. But it was a sentival decision by the members of the family. Just staying in bed for as long as possible and do no work. To these French farmers, working more to earn more did not seem like a good idea. Instead of working throughout the year, the people of one village on the round river, made enough money for one year at the summer fair. They spent the rest of the year relaxing, hunting and sleeping. Few people needed money until the twentieth century. They needed money for salt and iron. But they got most other supplies through exchanging goods. There wasn't a great need to make money. This helps explain why one of the winter industries in the high mountains was clock making. Spending long hours working on tiny mechanisms was way to make time pass faster.
