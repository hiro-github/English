The right sound

Designers are increasingly paying attention to making products then make less noise.
Steve Jobs for example did not want use fan to cool his first computer. He thought a fan would make too much noise. Since then, there has been broad movement to make products that are queiter.
The reason for doing this is clear. Noise is a problem that affects us all. In 2011, The world health organization published the report on health in the enrivonment.

The main enviromental cause bad health is air pollution. The second cause is noise pollution. Making a quieter enrivonment is good for people and for businesses too. Queit cars, printers, washing machines and airplanes maybe more expensive but these products consume less energy, that makes them cheaper to operate in the long run. Quiter airplanes as one example are better for everyone. People who leave near airport are happier, when noise decreases. People who fly on quiter planes find travelling less stressfull too. In the work place, machinery and air conditioning that is quiter maybe a bit more expensive but increases concentration and reduces fatigue. 

In general, noise is bad but complete silence is not good either. For pedestrians and people who are blind quiet electric cars and electric bicycles can be dangerous. It is important for such vehicles to make at least some sound for safety reasons. To let the user know that he or she has taken a photo, an artificial sound is added to digital cameras. There are other cases where sound is desirable, even though it is not necessary. Car manufacturers work hard, so that the closing of the car doors sound just right. They want to produce a sound that produces a feeling of high quality. For designers, the goal is not silence, but getting the sound right. And most of the time, right means quieter and making less noise.
