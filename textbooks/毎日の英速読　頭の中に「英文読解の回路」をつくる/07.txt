A camera thief

A group of researchers want to record the movements crocodiles in the river in Australia. To do this, they set up a small video camera along the edge of the river. It has a small motion sensor. When something moved in front of the lens, the video turned on.

When the researchers leader went to check on the camera, however the camera had disappeared. They guessed that it had fallen into the water and been washed away. After several months, someone found the camera, 110 kilometers away and returned it to research group. The researchers decided to look at the video they were able to see three 30 seconds sections. They could hardly believe their eyes.

On several occasions, one of their cameras had been moved by a wild animal. But this time was different. The film showed interesting scenery from high in the sky. After examining the film, the group discovered how the camera had disappeared. They also found out who the thief was. The film showed the wings of a bird as it grabbed the camera and took off. It shows short views of the land and the sky during its long journey, and then it showed the thief. It was a sea eagle. But there was another mystery. Why did the sea eagle carry the camera from such a long distance?

Sea eagles usually take what they catch, fly up into the sky and drop it. Dropping into the ground softens it and makes it easier to eat. The research group guess that this bird was young and still learning how to do things. It caught the camera in carried it away but didn't drop it. When it put the camera down, It started picking at it. When it did, it took a picture of itself.
