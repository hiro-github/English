GDP men

Each of us has an idea of what progress looks like, for some of us, it is a new place to live. For others it is a new television or trip abroad. For most goverments around the world however, progress is measured by just one statistic, gross domestic product or GDP. GDP includes how many goods companies produce; how much food farmers produce and how many new buildings builders put up. As the country's GDP rises, some people think the lifestyle of the people gets better. But not everyone agrees with this way of thinking. A higher GDP does not necessarily mean that the people of a country are happier or enjoying life more.

A new different way of measuring progress compares two categories of people, high GDP men and low GDP men. High GDP men has a long commute to work. He spends a lot of money on transportation between his home and his office. The stresses of his commute are not good for his heart or for his car if he drives. He works hard, spends a lot. and often goes to bars and restaurants. He and his wife both work. So they have to find someone to take care of their children. He and his wife are usually too busy to take long vacations.

In contrast, low GDP men spends a lot of time cooking, cleaning and taking care of his house. He grows some of his own vegetables. He borrows books from his local library instead of buying them. He eats at home and spends more time with his family. He exercises by doing housework rather than paying to belong to a gym. In terms of ecomonic measures, high GDP men has been rough. But we can not really be sure whether his life is any better. In terms of quality of life, low GDP men may be both happier and healthier.
