Keeping an eye on you

Everywhere we go, we are beeing watched. Security cameras record us in meeting rooms, restaurants and subway stations. These cameras are set up to protect people and prevent crimes. In stores, cameras are used to prevent stealing and to record atempts to steal money from the cash register. Now those scene cameras are serving another purpose. They are watching how we shop. They record how many people enter a store each hour it is open.

Managers can use this data to make staff schedules. When crowds come, the managers can be sure that there will be enouth sales people to serve them. Cameras in some shops are able to determine customers ethnicity. Noticing the groups of tourist from one foreign country came in the shop at the same time every day, the manager post a sale staff who could speak their language. Cameras also observe what products we look at and how we move through the store. Managers use this data to decide where to place caught on shelves, and how to attract the customer's attention.

Some stores have installed wide screen monitors to show floor plans and advertisement for special sale items, behind each monitors is a camera which knows eye movement. The camera tries to determine the viewer's gender and each groups. On the basis of this data, the screen then changes to show advertisement for products, that the person might like. Recently some stores track signals from cellphones. They can find out how many people walking by their store actually come in. They can count how many minutes a person stays in the store too, although, the store managers do not know who owns the phone. they do know how frequently, the phone and its owner enters the store.

In other words, they can recognize repeat customeres. Shop managers find this infomation very helpful for their business.
