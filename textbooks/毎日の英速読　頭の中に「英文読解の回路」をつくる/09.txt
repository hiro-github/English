The new bread winner

Until recently the husband was usually the bread winner of the American family. But increasingly it is the wife who earns more than half of the income of the family. According to one study, in families with top fifth the income categories, about 34 percent of the bread winners are women. In the bottom fifth however, close to 70 percent have women as a bread winner. Not all of these women are bread winners by choice. In many cases, restructuring and continuing poor economy have taken jobs from men. As a result, women have had to go to work in order to support their families. These women bread winners are likely to keep several bank accounts. They also have a bank account that their husbands do not know about. But when it comes to making decisions, many women let their husband take the leading role. In other words, they tried to support the image of the strong husband.

The change in who is the bread winner is not entirely surprising. For one thing, these days more than half of those who graduate from college are women. Second, women now make up fifty percent of the work force. Third, close to forty percent of women in the work force were never married or no longer married. It is only natural that they are the bread winners. Is this the end of men as the stronger half of the family? Are strong males giving way to strong females?

Most American men who are now working were raised in the generation after the women's movement. They grew up in a culture that emphasized the values of gender equality. It doesn't bother them that their wives earn more income. But many men's still want their own salary to be enough to support their family. These men may feel helpless. They may even feel ashamed that they are not the main bread winner.
