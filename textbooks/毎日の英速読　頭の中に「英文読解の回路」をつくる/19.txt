Musical medicine

Most of children's hospital has a staff member with an unusual job. He is not a doctor but he helps treat young patients at the hospital. He does this with his voice a guitar and other musical instruments. He is what is called a musical therapist. For example he helped the four-year old patient in the hospital who is worried about having an x-ray taken. The music therapist cater a room. And they began singing a song together with his guitar. The song continued as they got on the elevator. The girl, the therapist, the girl's parents and the nurse were all singing along. The x-ray was taken and they sing all the way back to the little girl's room. For the young patient, the x-ray was no longer a frightening experience.

The idea of using music to help young patients is catching on. Psychology said that music has the ability to reduce anxiety. It works because everyone relates to music in one way or another and it works in different ways. If the patient is anxious about something, music or fast tempo helped distract them. If the patient needs to relax the music with the slower tempo helps them do that too. Some music therapist works with adults too. Adult patient write words and the therapist and the patient tried to put music to the words. As they created a song together they talk about the meaning of the words. This is one way for the therapist to learn what the patient is worried about. Music therapist can also help adult patients learn how to relax. The speed and tone of the song that the patient and therapist sing or play, can change the patient's heart rate. It can also help lower blood pressure.

By using bio feedback the patient can learn to cautiously slow down his heart rate and lower his blood pressure. It's done by changing the music and enjoying it.
