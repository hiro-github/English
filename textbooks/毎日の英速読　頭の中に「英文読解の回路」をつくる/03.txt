Juan, the bear

Since the 1970's and 1980's zoos around the world have tried to reproduce the natural environment of their animals. They have taken out hard concrete floors and steel bars. They have put in grass, trees and course of water. These environment seemed more natural to humans. But what about the animals? It is true that the animals do not have to worry about finding food, shelter or safety from enemies.

All the necessities of life seem to be provided for them. Well this may not seem like such a bad deal, the animals experienced the worst problems. The zebras for example, live in fear, they can smell the lions in the nearby great cat exhibit every day. And they are completely unable to escape, There is no possibility of moving to a safer place. Moreover, zoo animal can not gather food for the winter.

This must make the birds and animals feel they will die before long. They get food today but they have no way of knowing where their food will appear again tomorrow. They have no way to get foods for themselves. In short, zoo life is completely unnatural from the animals point of view.

Animals in zoos have almost no control of their own lives. in spite of the efforts of their human caretakers, animals in zoos may feel caught in a death trap. They're surrounded by walls, nets moat and glass. Every year some animals try to escape. Some of them succeed. In 2004 at the berlin's zoo there was a bear name Juan. This smart bear rode on a log across the moat surrounding his habitat. He then climbed the wall to freedom. He took a ride on zoo's merry go round. He enjoyed going down the slide. But eventually he was tranquilized by zoo officials and returned to his habitat.
