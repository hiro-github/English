Under the sea

Submarines carrying large crews and sophisticated instruments travel around the world under the surface of the sea. Now they have small silent companions called sea gliders.
Hundreds of these unmanned vessels are currently at work. The typical sea glider looks like a rocket.
Its small wings guide through the water. It travels very slowly in less than 1 km / h.
It uses an extremely small amount of power. As a result, it could stay out of the oceans for month at a time.
In 2009, a glider use a single battery charge to travel across the Atlantic ocean.

It took seven months to go across, sea gliders are already helping scientist to many things that were not possible before. These vessels can watch underwater volcanos. They can measure the size of iceberg.
They can follow a school of fish. They can track effects of pollution in water in various steps.
Scientists are beginning to use them to create maps of the ocean floor.
Gliders are already able to carry out missions that last several months. But now a researcher in Japan is at work on a solar powered glider called Sora. This vessel rises to the surface for few days to recharge, then continues its work. As a result, it can stay at sea for years if necessary.

Currently, sea gliders cost about 150 thousand dollars to produce. But that cost is very small considering what they can do. Vessels can use them to survey the ocean floor to explore for oil and gas. Government can use them to gather intelligence. Without being spot in, a glider can identify ships on the surface or submarines that pass near it. At present the only enemies of the sea gliders are fishing net and sharks. But if the number of these wilders increases there maybe a traffic jam at rush hour.
